                            <h3>Flexbox</h3>
                            <p><strong>Flexible Box Layout</strong> is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model
                                optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. In the
                                flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction,
                                and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid
                                overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be
                                easily manipulated.</p>

                            <p>In the following example a container has been set to display: flex, which means that the
                                child items become flex items. The value of justify-content has been set to
                                space-between in order to space the items out evenly on the main axis. An equal amount
                                of space is placed between each item with the left and right items being flush with the
                                edges of the flex container.</p>
                            <pre>
                                <code>
    .box {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    }
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                            <h3>Grid</h3>
                            <p>CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship
                                of elements in terms of size, position, and layer.</p>
                            <p>Like tables, grid layout enables the developer to align elements into columns and rows.
                                However, many more layouts are possible as well as easier with CSS grid than they were
                                with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so
                                they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.</p>
                            <p>The example below has a container set to display: grid. This grid has 7 columns divided
                                equally between the containers area. The fr unit stands for fraction of the containers
                                area. The area is laid out to have the "head" area on top taking up 5 columns and the
                                first row, the "main" area on the second row, "ft" on the third, and a side bar taking
                                up the last two columns on all the rows. If you are viewing this page at a resolution of
                                900 pixels or greater you can see this exact layout.</p>
                            <pre>
                                <code>
    .gridContainer {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
    "head head head head head side side"
    "main main main main main side side"
    "ft ft ft ft ft side side";
    grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
    gap: 1rem;
    }
                                </code>
                            </pre>
